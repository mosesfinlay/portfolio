# Techdegree Project Seven
## Portfolio Site

This project is a portfolio site that uses node.js and express.

I Changed a few things in the CSS to get an **Exceeds Grade**.

* Font - I changed the font from Merriweather to Lato
* Background Color - I changed the background color to light grey
* Box Shadows - I added a box shadow to each project on the home page
